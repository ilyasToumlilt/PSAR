== Description ==
   -> Embedded map application for the car: this fits into the framework of a
      collaboration with Renault on the performance of mixed criticality
      tasks on a multi-core. The purpose of this PSAR
      is to bring an application for an industrial map
      to make the memory profile using a tool developed in
      the team and to study its impact on a real-time task
      running on a dedicated core.
